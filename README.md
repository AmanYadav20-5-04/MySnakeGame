# üêç Python Snake Game üéÆ

A classic arcade-style Snake game built entirely with Python's `turtle` graphics module. Guide your snake to eat food, grow longer, and aim for the highest score, all while avoiding walls and your own tail!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Enjoy the traditional Snake game mechanics.
* **Retro Look:** Black background, green snake, and red food bordered by a white frame for a familiar arcade feel.
* **Smooth Animation:** Uses `screen.tracer(0)` for fluid snake movement.
* **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of your current score during gameplay.
* **High Score Persistence:** Automatically saves and loads the highest score achieved to/from a `high_score.txt` file, even after closing the game.
* **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with screen boundaries and the snake's own body.
* **Responsive Controls:** Navigate the snake using the `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, and `Right` arrow keys.
* **Game Over Delay:** A brief 1.5-second pause after game over before restarting, giving players time to react.
